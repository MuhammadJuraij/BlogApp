        note:'Climate change reduces productivity and earnings for working-age adults. Over the last 60 years, rising temperatures lengthened the transition season for malaria, increasing by 32% in the Americas and 14% in highlands Africa. This surge in disease, especially among vulnerable workers, leads to higher absenteeism and decreased productivity. As working-age adults work less and are not as productive, they earn less income and face increased poverty.  This graph clearly illustrates how extreme heat reduces productivity, with earnings lost to heat as a share of GDP across different regions and industrial sectors. Agricultural workers in poorer regions, like Africa and South-East Asia, are the most affected.',
